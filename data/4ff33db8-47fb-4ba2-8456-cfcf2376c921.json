      "title": "Hero of Alexandria's Aeolipile",
      "content": "While not a practical engine, Hero of Alexandria's Aeolipile (1st century AD) demonstrated the principle of steam power. This device used steam jets to rotate a hollow sphere, showcasing early understanding of steam's potential.",
      "imagePrompt": "A detailed, artistic rendering of Hero of Alexandria's Aeolipile. The Aeolipile is a brass sphere mounted on a cauldron over a fire. Steam escapes from two curved nozzles on opposite sides of the sphere, causing it to spin. The scene should be set in ancient Alexandria, with scrolls and tools visible in the background. The lighting should highlight the brass and the steam.",

      "content": "Thomas Savery's pump (1698), known as the 'Miner's Friend', was one of the first commercially viable steam-powered devices. It used vacuum created by condensing steam to draw water from mines, albeit inefficiently and prone to explosions.",
      "imagePrompt": "A detailed illustration of Thomas Savery's 'Miner's Friend' steam pump. The pump is depicted in a flooded mine, showing how it draws water upwards through a series of pipes. Label key components such as the boiler, steam chamber, and cold water spray. The illustration should convey the device's industrial setting and the hazardous conditions of early mining.",

      "imagePrompt": "A cutaway diagram of Thomas Newcomen's atmospheric engine. Illustrate the key components: the boiler, cylinder, piston, beam, and water pump. Show the process of steam entering the cylinder, condensing to create a vacuum, and the piston being pulled down by atmospheric pressure. Label each part clearly and indicate the flow of steam and water.",
      "videoPrompt": "A short animation showing the cycle of Newcomen's Atmospheric Engine. Starting with steam filling the cylinder, then cold water condensing it to create a vacuum, pulling the piston down. The beam connected to the piston moves, driving a pump at the other end. The cycle repeats continuously. Style: Simple, schematic animation.",
