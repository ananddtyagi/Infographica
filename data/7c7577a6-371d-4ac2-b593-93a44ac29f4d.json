  "narrative": "Contrary to the image of a sink full of soapy water, a dishwasher acts more like a mechanical rainstorm. It combines high heat, chemical detergents, and pressurized spray arms to strip food away from dishes, filtering and recirculating a small amount of water to clean efficiently before pumping it all away.",

      "title": "It's Not a Bathtub",
      "content": "Many believe dishwashers fill completely with water, but they actually use a surprisingly small amount. The machine is a watertight seal that pools a shallow layer of water at the bottom, which is then continuously recycled throughout the wash cycle.",
      "imagePrompt": "A cross-section 3D render of a dishwasher in operation, showing a low water level at the very bottom basin only, contrasting with the dry air space in the rest of the machine where the racks are.",

      "title": "The Heating Element",
      "content": "Cold water enters through an intake valve, but it needs to be much hotter to melt grease and kill bacteria. A metal heating element at the bottom, often called a calrod, heats the water to temperatures between 130°F and 150°F (55°C - 65°C).",
