      "title": "The Illusion of Life: Optical Toys",
      "content": "Before film existed, inventors created optical toys like the Zoetrope and Phenakistiscope to simulate motion. These devices relied on the 'persistence of vision' phenomenon, where the eye retains an image for a fraction of a second, blending separate drawings into a moving picture.",
      "imagePrompt": "A vintage antique Zoetrope spinning on a polished mahogany table, sepia-toned lighting, detailed brass mechanics, viewing slits revealing a looping animation of a galloping horse sketch inside.",

      "content": "In the early 20th century, pioneers like Winsor McCay brought drawings to life with frame-by-frame hand animation. Artists drew thousands of individual sketches on paper to create just a few minutes of fluid movement, establishing the foundation of character animation.",
