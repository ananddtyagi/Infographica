      "title": "Anatomy of a Toilet",
      "content": "A standard toilet is comprised of two main sections: the tank, which acts as a water capacitor, and the bowl, which handles waste. The system relies on gravity and simple mechanics rather than electricity to function.",
      "imagePrompt": "A clean, high-contrast technical cross-section illustration of a standard porcelain toilet. The image highlights the separation between the upper tank containing mechanical parts and the lower bowl with the S-shaped trapway. Parts are labeled with simple lines.",

      "title": "The Water Seal",
      "content": "Before a flush, water sits in the bowl's trapway, acting as a vital barrier. This water seal prevents unpleasant and dangerous sewer gases from rising up the pipes and entering the bathroom.",
      "imagePrompt": "A focused diagram of the S-trap (trapway) at the bottom of the toilet bowl. Blue water fills the curve, clearly blocking green wavy lines representing sewer gas coming from the pipe below. Technical vector style.",

      "title": "The Chain Reaction",
      "content": "Pushing the handle triggers a mechanical linkage inside the tank. The handle lifts a lever arm, which pulls a chain to raise the flapper valve, allowing the stored water to rush into the bowl.",
      "imagePrompt": "Cutaway view of the toilet tank interior. A transparent hand presses the external handle, causing the internal lever to rise and lift a rubber flapper at the bottom of the tank via a chain.",

      "title": "The Siphon Effect",
      "content": "As water floods the bowl, it fills the S-shaped trapway faster than it can exit. This creates a vacuum that pulls the waste and water down the drain against gravity, a physical phenomenon known as siphoning.",

      "videoPrompt": "Animated diagram of the toilet bowl trapway. Water rushes in from the rim, filling the S-curve completely. The water mass travels over the peak of the trap, creating a suction effect that visibly pulls the contents down the pipe.",

      "title": "The Float Shut-Off",
      "content": "As the water level rises, it lifts a float (either a ball or a cup) connected to the fill valve. When the float reaches a specific height, it shuts off the water supply, leaving the toilet ready for the next user.",
