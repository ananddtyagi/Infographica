      "title": "The Humble Beginnings: Mastabas",
      "content": "Before the towering pyramids, Egyptian pharaohs were buried in low, flat-roofed rectangular structures called mastabas, made of mud brick. These tombs represented the eternal mound of creation and served as the architectural foundation for the grandeur that followed.",
